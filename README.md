Additional information
----------------------

To export the VOWL visualization to an SVG image, all css styles have to be included into the SVG code.
This means that if you change the CSS code in the `vowl.css` file, you also have to update the code that
inlines the styles - otherwise the exported SVG will not look the same as the displayed graph.

The tool which creates the code that inlines the styles can be found in the util directory. Please
follow the instructions in its [README](util/VowlCssToD3RuleConverter/README.md) file.



OWL2VOWL converter 
==================

Owl2Vowl is an ontology converter used to convert the given ontology to a json format that is used in the WebVOWL visualization. 


Requirements
------------
